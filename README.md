# Dark-Karma-Bot
This is the community Discord bot I have started working on. Right now it's pretty simple, however, I plan to make it more advanced over time. Too many bots these days try charging monthly subscriptions for the simplest of tasks. I for one am tired of it. So this bot looks to replace those silly practices and give power back to communities by allowing users to host their own bot. If you like the work, give us a star. If you know how and want to help improve the bot, then feel free to contribute or leave us a suggestion.

# Who can use the bot?
Anyone and everyone. Like I said, this bot aims to give power back to communities. This knowledge is freely given to anyone who wants it. No credits needed, no thanks required.

# What exactly do I need to make this bot work?
You will want to edit some of the command replies and the group IDs to match your own info, however, keep in mind this is just the source code to the bot. You will need your own token and bot settings on the developer portal of Discord.

If you are new to hosting a discord bot, we have created a [wiki](https://github.com/x0Z3ro0x/Dark-Karma-Bot/wiki) to help guide you. Check it out or join the discord if you need further assistance! Seriously, we help all levels of talent, even users without any computer literacy so don't be shy.
